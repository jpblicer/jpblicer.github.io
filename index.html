            <h1>WELCOME</h1>
            <p>I am a Tokyo Based aspiring Software Developer / Engineer.</p>
            <p>Enitrely self-taught JavaScript Developer with knowledge of the two core technologies React and Node.</p>
            <p>My background is in Technical Recruitment for Major Consulting Firms where I have found great success including 4 promotions in a 5 year period. While the Recruitment industry has been good to me, I find my self consistently pulled towards IT, especially Software. What started as a curiosity has grown into a full commitment to build up a lifestyle and career dedicated to the creation of Software solutions that can solve the worlds problems, both big and small.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am looking for a company where I can put my time management, communication / writing skills, and end user approach to great use while also having support to learn the best practices of software development in a business setting.</p>  
            <p>While my most immediate value add would be in the form of JavaScript web development, I am not closing any doors to other areas of Software development opportunities that you would like to consider me for; as languages are just the tools used to create the solution</p>
            <p>Please feel free to <a href="/contact/contact.html">CONTACT</a> me if you feel I can contribute to your organization.</p>
